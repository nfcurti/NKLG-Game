# NKLG-Game

North Korea Liberation Gang is a Javascript based anti communist game where your objective is to retrieve all the treasures the communist regime has stolen from their people.

Built around Phaser.js library:

- [Phaser: 2d gaming using vanilla javascript](https://phaser.io)

For help getting started with Phaser, view their docs 
[online documentation](https://phaser.io/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on game development.

## Getting Started

This project is a weekend project I built while learning some game development.

In order to make it work just clone the repo and run 

``` npm install```

```node app.js ```


## Customization

Inside the public directory there's a filled called game.js which renders the full canvas and also handles game options.

For example, if you want gravity to be heavier change

``` 
// player gravity
    playerGravity: 1500,
```

to

``` 
// player gravity
    playerGravity: 2000,
```
