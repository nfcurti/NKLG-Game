## Getting Started

This project is a weekend project I built while learning some game development.

In order to make it work just clone the repo and run 

``` npm install```

```node app.js ```


## Customization

Inside the public directory there's a file called game.js which renders the full canvas and also handles game options.

# Gravity 

``` 
// player gravity
    playerGravity: 1500,
```

to

``` 
// heavier player gravity
    playerGravity: 2000,
```

# Jump Force 

``` 
// player jump force
    jumpForce: 600,
```

to

``` 
// player jump force (jumps higher)
    jumpForce: 800,
```
